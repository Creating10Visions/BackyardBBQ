This project is to demonstrate (OOP) Object-Oriented programming principles using Java Interfaces and classes
It involves creating different types of meal classes that implement Meal_Cook and display information about each meal.

The first- class name BackyardBBQ shows you've either used propane or charcoal to frill. 
The Second class is named ThanksgivingDinner sharing that you can use the over and roasting pan for the turkey.
The third class is name HeartyStew and shows whether you used a crockpost or a stovetop to make the soup.
The fourth class is called CookingDinner which includes your main method that runs the program effectively while
also printing out programmers details. Mean_Cook acts as the interface for BackyardBBQ, ThanksgivingDinner and HeartyStew.
